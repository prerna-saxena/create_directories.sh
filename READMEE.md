Deploy to a Cloud Provider
AWS: Use Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to manage your Kubernetes cluster.
GCP: Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Azure: Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Set up auto-scaling in your Kubernetes cluster to handle increased load. This typically involves configuring Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) and Cluster Autoscalers.

5. Access the Application
Once deployed, your web application will be accessible via the LoadBalancer service, which provides a public IP or DNS name.
Summary
Version Control: Git repository with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
Containerization: Dockerfile to create container images.
Orchestration: Kubernetes deployment and service manifests.
Scalability: Use cloud-based Kubernetes services and auto-scaling features.
This setup will ensure that your application is deployed automatically on code pushes, scalable to handle increased load, and accessible via a web browser.
